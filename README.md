## Synopsis
It is an image **upload-download server** application. It is equipped with **user registration** system.It uses
**PHP** and **MySQL** at backend. For frontend I did not do much work, just picked up a template ( frontend was not part of my agenda).

## Extension
Looking to attach a 'like' feature as there is in instagram.
